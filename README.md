# Antenna 

## Project Objective
The Antenna project is a MATLAB-based exploration of antenna radiation patterns and array factors in both 2-D and 3-D. By completing this exercise, you will gain familiarity with using MATLAB software to visualize and analyze different antennas and antenna arrays.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three parts, each with its specific focus:

### Part 1: Linear Antenna (Dipole of General Length)
In Part 1, you will write a MATLAB code to sketch the radiation pattern of a general-length dipole in both 2-D and 3-D. The code will prompt the user to enter the length of the dipole and then visualize the radiation pattern.

### Part 2: Uniform Linear Antenna Array (ULA)
Part 2 involves creating a MATLAB code to sketch the array factor of a general uniform linear antenna array in both 2-D and 3-D. The code will ask the user for the number of elements in the array, the progressive phase shift, and the spacing between elements before generating the pattern.

### Part 3: Nonuniformly-Fed Linear Antenna Array
#### A. Binomial Arrays
This section focuses on binomial linear antenna arrays. Your MATLAB code will allow users to sketch the array factor of a general binomial linear antenna array in both 2-D and 3-D. Input parameters include the number of elements in the array, the progressive phase shift, and the spacing between elements.

#### B. Dolph-Tshebysceff Arrays
In this part, you will create a MATLAB code to sketch the array factor of a general Tshebysceff linear antenna array in both 2-D and 3-D. Users will be prompted to enter the number of elements in the array, the progressive phase shift, the spacing between elements, and the main lobe to side lobe level (Ro).

## Examples
To help users understand how to use the code and what to expect, we have provided example scenarios for each part of the project.

### Example 1:
For each part of the project, we include specific examples with user inputs and expected results. These examples will serve as a guide to running the MATLAB code effectively.

### Example 2:
Another example scenario illustrates how the code behaves under different input conditions, allowing users to explore various antenna configurations.

## Usage
Feel free to explore and utilize the MATLAB code and resources in this repository to visualize and analyze antennas and antenna arrays. The provided examples will help you get started with running the code for your own projects or research in the field of antenna engineering.
